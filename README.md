# General Bot
General bot records all messages that are sent while he is active and notifies a specified user when someone deletes a message. 

By changing boolean value "UPDATEMESSAGES" to true will mean that general bot starts up he will pull every message from every channel in a specified server (this takes awhile!). 

General bot is my solution to a bot not knowing what messages were sent before it starting running.
